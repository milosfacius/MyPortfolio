      <div class="article-intro">

        <h2>challenge</h2>
        <p>Design and implement a game that is inspired by 2D retro gaming, such as
          Silkworms, Xenon 2 or super Cars 2. Important factors included correspondence of
          game concept with implementation, smoothness of integration of game features with
          each other, and appropriateness and elegance of implementation. The game should be
          reasonably challenging to play, with game features such as starting a game, winning/losing,
          restart, score and five levels which are functionally different. The game should also include
          various kinds of opponents or enemies which are functionally different and implement basic enemy behaviour.</p>

          <h2>solution</h2>
          <p> Pocket Tanks is a 2-player-arena game, in which the players battle to earn the highest score by destroying each other.
            The players each control a tank, that has the ability to shoot bullets, in order to try and hit the opponent.
            It has a tennis-style layout, in which the players aren’t able to cross the middle part of the arena. Progress equals higher difficulty.

          <p> Pocket Tanks is written from scratch by me. The game isn't online and thus can't be played from a browser.

          <h2> levels</h2>
          <p>The game holds 5 levels, where each level is changing the environment of the game. First level is gladiator-like empty,
            where the players are facing each other dead-on. When a player hits 0 lives, the next level is entered, where a new arena
            is presented, in which either obstacles to hide behind or interfering enemies show up - maybe both!

          <h2> osbtacle collision </h2>
          <p>Every bullet that hits the opposite player awards 1 point. In order to prevent spawn camping, the player that was hit,
            will turn invincible for 5 seconds, but unable to shoot for the time being.
            <br><br>
            It is important to try and avoid the enemies, as this will decrease the player’s life by 1 -
            but this won’t award any points to the opposite player. One might think, that a strategy could be to suicide to the enemies,
            if you are in front, but as every level progression awards the winning player with 5 points, the lost points to the other player
            from the suicides will do you no good!

          <h2> bullet movement</h2>
          <p>The obstacles doesn’t have bullet penetration, so the players are able to seek cover,
            but remember: bonus points is awarded for finishing the game within 100 seconds, 1 for each
            second < 100, so don’t take too long hiding behind obstacles!
