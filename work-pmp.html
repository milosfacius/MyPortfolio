        <h2>challenge</h2>
        <p>When people buy a dog, many forget about the time investment it takes,
          which can cause problems in everyday life. Studies show that dog owners may
          find it difficult to find qualified passers, especially when spontaneous plans arise where the dog can not come.</p>

          <h2>solution</h2>
          <p> PetMyPet provides dogs owners access to a network of competent carer in the
            local area through transparent and trustworthy service. The service incorporates
            technology to make the care more transparent and safe.
            <br><br>
            In addition, the service
            offers that the verified carers freely regulate prices and times when they can fit pets
            and allow them to take advantage of their time and abilites, in order to create profit.

          <h2>service design thinking</h2>
          <p>Service design thinking combines several different methods of design,
            management and concept development. Service design can be used to create new
            innovations or be used to improve existing service so it becomes more sought after,
            user-friendly and effective for either the organization or the user.
            <br> <br>
            In order to understand the service design concept, it is relevant to define the values people
            draw from services. There are three core values: Care, Access and Response.
            <br><br>
            Service design can both be beneficial to the user, but largely also a tool the organization can utilize to identify vulnerable links in their service that can be streamlined.
            There are often five basic principles behind service in design thinking:
            <br><br>
            <b>· User-centered services</b>, must be viewed from the user's perspective.
            <br>
            <b>· Co-creative</b>, all stakeholders should be included in the design process.
            <br>
            <b>· Sequencing</b>, the design must be visualized as a scenario with each other. related interactions.
            <br>
            <b>· Evidencing</b>, intangible designs should be visualized with physical artifacts.
            <br>
            <b>· Holistic</b>, the total service must be processed and included in the consideration.
          </p>

          <h2>service blueprint</h2>
          <p>Service blueprint is a tool used to create an overview of a service of
            various touchpoints as well as to gather the various stakeholders of the organization.
            <br>
            Designers and organizations can use this to categorize and work systematically
            with the knowledge they have about the service and the underlying points.
            This overview allows them to zoom in on certain points in the service and
            identify where improvements and changes can be made.
            <br><br>
            When the user signs up for the service, the registration will be reviewed by
            employees who consider the registrations individually and approve or reject.
            This is supported by the results of the analysis, which demonstrates the need
            for a validation process for users to rely on the service. In addition, the
            entered data must be saved and created on the profile. Information such as Mobile number,
            facebook, email can be verified with software.
            <br><br>
            PetMyPet to promote the best rated carers. This is done to give the carers an
            incentive to improve the experience and improve the functionality of pet owners
            who choose only high rated passes. In addition, there will be logged response times
            from the carers - a metric that will be displayed on the profile.
            The payment for the passport will be transferred from the pet owner to PetMyPet.
            This is done to manage cash flow internally and ensure that the money transaction is progressing as it should.

          <h2>user journey</h2>
          <p>When creating the user journey, we focused on making the it as convenient as possible.
            This meant making the service timeline as effective as possible, for example, by allowing
            users to fill in their profiles while waiting for their verifications to be approved.
            The fact that users should wait for their profile to be verified would normally be negative
            as it draws service timeline out. In this case, however, it is positive when it was determined
            in the analysis that this verification process is vital for users to rely on the service.
            <br><br>
            We have been focusing on evidencing - as major parts of customer travel are digital.
            Therefore, it is important to alert users to items that take place behind closed doors,
            such as to let users know that their registration is being processed and their verifications are being checked.

          <h2>concept</h2>
          <p>The overall research question of the project has been to identify the essential
            factors for the sharing of living beings. With inspiration from Airbnb and GoMore,
            we have designed a sharing-economical concept that connects animal owners with a network of animal care providers,
            consisting of individuals. To this end, with a service design approach, we have undergone an
            iterative design process with user involvement, more specifically focus group workshops and questionnaire surveys.
            <br><br> As PetMyPet is a concept design it hasn't been launched and was never intended to. The concepts results and data was shared
            with the Danish company <a href="https://dogley.com" target="_blank"> <span class="colorAccent">www.dogley.com </span></a>, which
            created a similar business and received over 1 million DKK and launched internationally in 2017.
