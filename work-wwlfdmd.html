      <div class="article-intro">
        <h2> project overview </h2>

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>The field of web-design is rapidly growing and as such, it is vital for emerging designers to
          acquire a set of skills, methods, theories and knowledge that can help them cater to this
          need. The Digital Media and Design (DMD) programme does just that. However since the
          DMD programme at the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU) deals with innovative design
          processes and newly formed and broad theoretical subjects due to the rapid developing
          IT-universe, people rarely have a preexisting knowledge of what it might contain.</p>

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p> The aim for this project was to create a website that deals with this problem through outlines of
            the courses and subjects of the DMD programme and the skills attained through these with
            the possibility of expanding it to a broader scope.
            <br><br>
            The aim is not to fully explain the subject
            of the courses that have been taught, but rather to form a quick overview of relevant theory,
            methods, and tools presented over the course of the programme.</p>

            <h3>Tools</h3>

          <h3>User interviews</h3>
          <p>The purpose of the interviews was to validate (or reject) the idea of a website like WWLFDMD
            as well as to empathize with the students’ experiences and frustrations regarding the complexity of their degree.
            <br> <br>
            By being open-minded and accept the user’s opinions and comments, the data was translated unbiased.
            The statements was used as the framework for the website and as design drivers representative
            of the target group’s views on the DMD programme.
          </p>

          <h3> Wireframes</h3>
          <p>The purpose and the strengths of wireframes is that they are a good tool for describing
            the functionality and behaviour of a website, as well as how content should be arranged.
            <br>
            The wireframes was mainly used as a communication tool, to conversate and figure out, which
            direction the design should be taken.
            <br><br>
            The production of wireframes was initialized by hand drawn sketches.
            From the perspective of the sketches, ideas were refined and explained in order to combine the sketches into wireframes.
            By discussing thoughts and ideas behind the ideation stage of the sketches, the design space converged into a
            common position.
          </p>

          </div>

          <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
          <p>Sketching was used as a tool to open up the design space and let the ideation stream flow.
            By having no predefined rules in terms of the design, the only thing that influenced the
            sketches were the concept surrounding the idea and the categories that were being discussed
            during this step of the process: <br><br> landing page <br> overview page <br> content page
            <br><br>
            The result of our sketch session, were three to four pages from each team member.
            These pages were used to ideate and discuss the design and structure of our website going forward,
            which resulted in specific design decisions regarding both mockups and wireframes.
          </p>

          <h3>Prototyping and testing</h3>
          <p>The usability test was executed with four participants from the target group.
            Two were presented with the desktop version of WWLFDMD, while the two others used the mobile-version.
            <br> <br>
            The participants were introduced to a task that focused on navigation by
            locating different pages of content. This seeked to test if the participants
            made use of all the navigational features and understood the navigation signifiers.
            After the task, the participants were asked about their experience, opinion and general
            attitude towards the website and its features. A computer or cell phone were used for the user
            to interact with, while another computer were used to write down notes, comments and observations.
