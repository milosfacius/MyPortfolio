  <div class="article-intro">
    <p><a href="https://sjwinther.github.io/wwlfdmd/index.html" target="_blank">What We Learnt From DMD</a> (WWLFDMD) is a high fidelity prototype showcasing an online encyclopedia for fellow students to use. It's a quick overview of relevant theory, methods, and tools from the bachelor, <a href="https://en.itu.dk/programmes/bsc-programmes/digital-media-and-design" target="_blank">Digital Media and Design</a>, I as a designer (and student) have experienced.</p>

  <h2>Challenge</h2>
  <div class="article-text">
    <p>The field of digital design is rapidly growing and as such, it is vital for emerging designers to acquire a set of skills, tools, methods, theories and knowledge that can help them cater to this need. The Digital Media and Design (DMD) programme at the IT University of Copenhagen does just that. As a student of the programme I've found that I was in need of an encyclopedia or/and tool-box of what I learned from DMD. This was also highly reflected through an empathy phase with other students.
      <br><br>
    WWLFDMD became an invitation for fellow students and like-minded to explore these subjects through short articles with examples from DMD and the industry to better communicate and navigate in an evolving designerly practice.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Process</h2>
  <div class="article-text">
    <p>The process roughly follows the principles and fluid phases of Design Thinking. It started with gaining empathy with users – students – by doing interviews and defining problem statements and design principles from those insights. These lead to statements that functioned as drivers for the ideation process which led to lo-fi and hi-fi prototyping and testing.
      <br><br>
    Throughout this process tools and methods such as sketching, wire framing, mockups, card sorting and usability testing interactive prototypes was utilised. A project report with reflections on the design practice was written afterwards.</p>

  <h2>Learnings</h2>

  <div class="article-text">
    <p>Even though I finished my BSc degree’s in DMD before this project, the process of designing WWLFDMD gave me newfound clarity regarding the knowledge I attained through the DMD programme - a testament to the relevance of a website like that which was created.</p>
