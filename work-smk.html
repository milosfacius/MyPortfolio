        <h2>challenge</h2>
        <p> Within recent years, more museeums have digitalized and made their art collections accessible
          so their visitors can enjoy the whole collection - even outside of the museeum.
          The museums' accessibility of the cultural heritage enables users to interact with
          it in new ways and invite users to play, remix and use the works, in their own creative ways.
          In collaboration with the Danish National Museeum of Art, the challenge for this project was as follows:
          <br> <br>
          How can this new digital accessibility be used to create engaging user experiences with art from the collection at SMK?
        </p>

        <h2>solution</h2>
        <p> The solution of this project resulted in an app which offered art experiences outside
          the traditional four walls of the museum. The app consists of two different functions:
          <br> <br>
          · A interactive art map, where art works are geographicaly placed, based on context
          and relation to the geographical location. <br><br>
          · A selection of different curated art routes, which users could use to explore the local environment.
          <br><br>

        <h2>spaces of innovation</h2>
        <p> This project took advantage of the three spaces of innovation to make sure
          that the design process was dynamic and iterative.<br>
          The spaces of innovation focuses on the design process and is viewed as spaces
          where the design team can iteratively move between these as needed.
          <br><br>
          The inspiration space was used as a place to explore or examine a problem, need or opportunity
          which lead to motivation in order to find a solution. Within this space
          I searched for insights and did observations and desk research.
          <br><br>
          The ideation space is where I generated, developed and tested ideas. Tools such
          as brainstorming, prototyping and user testing were used here. Prototyping and
          testing was done often, in order to generate a hands-on feeling with the ideas
          and to test their feasibility.
          <br><br>
          The implementation space was where the I mapped the path from desk to market.
          I alternateded between these different spaces during the design process and after launch
          and implementation, I began work on optimization and design.

        <h2> user interviews</h2>
        <p> User interviews were used to search for insights in the users relationship towards four differnet
          themes; museums, SMK, Art and Media.
          Through the exploration of these themes, we identified the following insights, which
          was to be used in order to move forward with the concept:
          <br><br>
          · It can be 'a lot' to go to the museum and experience art.
          <br>
          · You must have a specific predetermination when visiting a museum.
          <br>
          · The "cool" museums are interactive and convey art in a new creative way.
          <br>
          · Art is boring when it lacks context.
          <br>
          · You often have to be quiet and can not have fun.
          <br>
          · It's coolest with friends, all of whom are at the same level of interest.
          <br><br>
          Based on these insights, we found it interesting to look at how
          these users fit into a larger cultural context and segmentation ~ cultural segments.
        </p>
        <div class="article-text-pic">

        </div>

        <h2> cultural segments</h2>
        <p>The culture segments are based on the user's habits and motivation.
          There are 8 different cultural segments, each distinguishing from each other
          based on the segment's conviction of the role that art and culture play in their lives;
          what they are motivated by; as well as how to develop strategies that can engage them more in cultural life.
          <br>
          Based on the insights from our user interviews, we found the most similarities
          and correlations with the two cultures; entertainment (entertainment) and confirmation (affirmation).
          <br><br>
          <i>Entertainment:</i> The entertainment segment consists of a high level of conventional younger
          adults for whom art can be found in the periphery of their lives. They often tend against spectacular,
          entertaining or must-see events.
          <br>
          <i>Confirmation:</i>The confirmation segment consists predominantly of young and younger adults,
          for whom art is one of many possible leisure activities. They are adventurous when it comes to art and
          culture, and sees it as a tool to develop as an individual and improve their lives.

        </div>

        <h2>design principples</h2>
        <p>Based on the insights from users' thoughts and feelings about the four themes,
          we were able to more easily define the needs of the target group and set the need
          in relation to the challenge posed by SMK and the cultural segments.
          Thus, we could develop a number of design principles that should serve as guidelines for our further work,
          including ideation space.
          <br> <br>
          · The concept must be inclusinve and engaging the user.
          <br>
          · The concept must put art in a geographical context and create a relationship.
          <br>
          · The concept should be informative, but not didactic.
          <br>
          · The concept must enable exploration of its area through art.
          <br>
          · The concept must be able to enter into a social context.
        </p>
        <div class="article-text-pic">
          <img src="images/work/smk/principles.jpg" alt="Product">
        </div>

        <h2>prototyping & concept</h2>
        <p> The overall idea of the concept is a combination between providing art enthusiasts,
          an alternative to traditional museums, while using SMK's major unused recruitment.
          <br><br>
          Our concept should be used to seek alternatives to traditional cultural dissemination and
          explore the user's area - and curiosity for it - while presenting art. The final concept is an
          app that contains an interactive map of the area in which it is located.
          It is up to the user whether they want to explore the map and thus on their own,
          find works of art in the cityscape and the context of art location. Alternatively,
          the user can also use the SMK-curated routes, based on a narrative, based on the art and the area.
          <br><br>
          The concept should be seen as an alternative, to those who feel uninspired in relation to
          going to a museum in the traditional sense. By this it should be understood that there is a
          sense of duty in relation to fulfilling an undefined cultural quota, on which people feel the
          pressure to engage in culture. This product ensures that the user is not bound by the physical
          framework and thus can satisfy a part of their cultural sense of sense simply by opening the app.
