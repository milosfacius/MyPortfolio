        <h2>challenge</h2>
        <p>The challenge was to design a book cover which should combine the factual context of the book with the
          enticement and mystery of the story.</p>

          <h2>solution</h2>
          <p> The solution was a cover design that didn't portray the regular visuals from a non-fictional true crime story.
            In doing so the visual asthetics of the cover is more in line with fictional crime novels.
            <br> <br>
            The following sections will show the process from initial ideas towards the final concept.

          <h2> iterations</h2>
          <p> The proces of developing the cover design was structured around iterations. The design
            was influenced by the opinion of the publisher as well as the writers, but ultimately relient
            on creative freedom in terms of trying to portray the stakeholders graphical vision. The iterative process
            consisted of several sessions, in which I developed different takes on the cover design.
          </p>

          <h2> first iterations</h2>
          <p> The first iteration were basicly sketches to try and find a common ground between myself and the stakeholders.
            They wanted to include signifiers from the story such as the people involved, a gun or the get-away van. Thus
            I included some of these elements in the intitial design.
            <br><br>
            These are a few of the first design sketches that came about.
          </p>

          </div>

          <h2> second iterations</h2>
          <p> The second round of iterations were still heavily in the realm of sketches, but with a more focused
            attention towards the people involved in the story. The publisher showed interest in commercial reach and
            wanted something in the lines of movie posters
            <br><br>
            The second iterations were playing around with whitespacing and a more simplistic take.
          </p>

          </div>


          <h2> third iterations</h2>
          <p> The third wave of iterations was where the designs came more into shape and progressed towards a final design.
            Drawing from the previous sketches, these were heavily focused on spacing and a more traditional book cover.
            <br><br>
            Out of the third wave, the one on the far right were the one, that the stakeholders liked the most, which fueled
            the next and final stage of iterations.
          </p>

            <img src="images/work/book/third-iteration.jpg" alt="third-ite">
          </div>

          <h2> final iterations</h2>
          <p> The final stage of iterations were very close to the final design, with some minor changes towards
            typography, whitespace and overall visual display.
            <br><br>
            The changes were minor, as the previous waves of iterations had gathered a more specific visual identity.
            The final design was chosen by the stakeholders.
